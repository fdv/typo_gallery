TypoGallery
===========

A 20 minutes proof of concept for a Gallery plugin for Typo, using existing resources. It has pagination, lightbox etc... Crappy, but it's a POC.

Gallery is accessed at yourblog/gallery

Needs the HEAD version of Typo as on April the 7th 2011.

Please, add this in your config.routes.rb after the ActionController::Routing::Routes.draw do |map|

# Gallery plugin
map.connect 'gallery/page/:id', :controller => 'typo_gallery', :action => 'index'
map.connect 'gallery/:action/:id', :controller => 'typo_gallery'

And restart your Typo.
